- Your name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Your user ID: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_


**NOTE: When you add a listing in a report, you must format it properly!**
- Use a monotype font so that it is easily readable (e.g. Lucida Sans Console or Courier New). This means that all letters take up the same space on the page;
- Indent the code; and
- Use (colour) syntax highlighting.
- Show line numbers (optional)

## 1. Preliminaries: Install OpenCV if needed

Nothing to report here.

## Choose your programming language

- Why did you choose Python or C/C++?
(I won't mark this answer, I am just gathering feedback from you. Any answer is valid)


## 2. and 3 - Load and display an image [9 marks in total]

- Add your source code below [5 marks]
- **DO NOT FORGET TO ADD A PREAMBLE** [1 mark]. It must describe the program:

    1. the author of the program (you),
    2. the date,
    3. the purpose of the file (inc. the command line options),
    4. the todo-list if anything is missing.

- Add evidence of testing using three different images [3 marks].
    - Hint: just add the screenshots of your OpenCV window.

## 4. Convert a RGB image in a greyscale image [8 marks in total]

- Add your source code below [4 marks]
- **DO NOT FORGET TO ADD A PREAMBLE** [1 mark].
- Add evidence of testing using three different images [3 marks].
    - Hint: just add the screenshots of your OpenCV window.

## 5. Find the smallest and largest pixel values in an image [14 marks in total]

- Add a screenshot of your test image created using ImageJ after the division [2 marks]
- Add a screenshot of its histogram [1 mark]
- Add a screenshot of your test image created using ImageJ after the addition [2 marks]
- Add a screenshot of its histogram [1 mark]
- Add your source code below [5 marks]
- **DO NOT FORGET TO ADD A PREAMBLE** [1 mark].
- Add evidence of testing using your new test image.
    - Hint: Add the screenshot of the console that displays the min and max values [1 mark]
    - A screenshot of the table from ImageJ that displays the min and max values [1 mark]
    - Are the values identical?
        - If yes, test passed,
        - If not are they relatively similar?
            - If yes, test passed,
            - If not, test failed, you must debug the code.

## 6. Improve the contrast of an image

### by hand using the equation seen in the lecture [11 marks in total]

- Add your source code below [5 marks]
- **DO NOT FORGET TO ADD A PREAMBLE** [1 mark].
- Add evidence of testing using your test image.
    - Hint: add the screenshot of your OpenCV window when your displayed `float_image`. [1 mark]
    - Why was the image (mostly) white? [3 marks]
    - add the screenshot of your OpenCV window when your displayed `uint8_image`. [1 mark]

### using OpenCV's function [8 marks in total]

- Add your source code below [5 marks]
- **DO NOT FORGET TO ADD A PREAMBLE** [1 mark].
- Add evidence of testing using your test image.
    - Hint: add the screenshot of your OpenCV window when your displayed `uint8_image`. [1 mark]
    - add a screenshot of its histogram in ImageJ. [1 mark]
